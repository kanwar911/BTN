Implementation Status Report

This document outlines the current implementation status of the Smart Home Network Automation System project, aligned with the requirements in the BTN415 rubric.

Network Design Requirements
Subnetting with multiple subnets: Implemented
Documented in report/network_design.md with a VLSM-based layout to separate device types (lights, thermostat, camera).

Equal-size or VLSM: Implemented
VLSM applied to optimize IP allocation across different smart home device categories.

Static/default routing: Implemented
Static routing tables documented, showing communication paths between subnets.

ARP protocol integration: Implemented
ARP logic, flow, and cache management described in the design documentation.

Client-Server Application Requirements

Multithreaded server: Implemented
Built in server/main.cpp using threads to handle client connections.

Multiple client handling: Implemented
Each client spawns its own thread, enabling concurrent connections.

Server manages device state: Implemented
Server tracks and maintains the state of lights, thermostats, and cameras.

Client sends commands to server: Implemented
Implemented in client/client.cpp where the user enters and sends text commands.

TCP sockets for communication: Implemented
TCP sockets (WinSock2) used for reliable communication between client and server.

User interaction for commands: Implemented
Client prompts the user for commands via a simple text interface.

Text-based commands: Implemented
Uses a custom HTTP-like command format (e.g., GET /light/on).

Application Layer Protocol Requirements

HTTP-like protocol: Implemented
A structured GET-based protocol is used to communicate between client and server.

Command structure: Implemented
Commands follow the format: GET /resource/action[/parameter].

Server response format: Implemented
Server returns text responses confirming the action or providing device status.

Multithreading and Concurrent Device Management

Server multithreading: Implemented
The server uses threads to handle each client connection.

Concurrent client handling: Implemented
Multiple clients can interact with the server simultaneously.

Device thread representation: Partially implemented
Devices are managed as shared class instances, not separate threads.

Synchronization: Implemented
Critical sections or mutexes used to protect access to shared device state.

Thread safety: Implemented
Access to shared data is thread-safe, avoiding race conditions.

Routing and Network Communication:

Static/dynamic routing: Implemented (Design only)
Routing logic is explained in the documentation.

Subnet communication: Implemented (Design only)
Logical communication flow between subnets described in report.

Routing tables: Implemented
Static routing table included in the network design section.

IP address resolution: Implemented (Design only)
Covered under ARP section in the documentation.

ARP for MAC resolution: Implemented (Design only)
Simulated ARP process described in detail.

Critical Thinking and Integration

Coherent functional system: Implemented
Fully integrated client-server system with device simulation and user control.

Network congestion handling: Partially implemented
Basic error handling is present, but no advanced congestion management.

Concurrent device control: Implemented
Achieved through synchronized multi-client support.

Error handling: Implemented
Basic handling of command parsing and socket issues.

Reliable data transmission: Implemented
Handled by TCP protocol ensuring message delivery.
Above and Beyond Feature: Web-Based Control Panel
A web-based control panel was added as an extra feature, enabling users to control smart devices from a browser.

Key Features:
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
Real-time device status updates
Visual interface for controlling lights, thermostat, and cameras
Dedicated web server thread running on port 8081
RESTful API endpoints using AJAX
Technical Implementation:
Web server logic defined in server/web_server.h
The interface uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction
AJAX handles real-time communication between browser and backend
Shared backend logic supports both CLI and browser interfaces
This feature significantly improves user experience and demonstrates frontend-backend integration using modern web development practices.

Summary
The project successfully meets all core BTN415 requirements, including multithreaded TCP communication, simulated device 
control, and application-layer protocol implementation. Network design and routing concepts are well-documented. The addition 
of a web-based control panel demonstrates initiative and modernizes the system interface.
